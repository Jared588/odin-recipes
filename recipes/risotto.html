    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Risotto is a northern Italian rice dish cooked with broth until it reaches a creamy consistency. The broth can be derived from meat, fish, or vegetables. Many types of risotto contain butter, onion, white wine, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, we'll be using Mushrooms.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
